# VS Code Extension Quality Fix

## Problem
The VS Code extension was producing "lower quality" output compared to the CLI because it wasn't actually displaying the generated component code. Instead, it was only showing the CLI's status messages.

## Root Cause
1. The CLI doesn't output component code to stdout - it saves files and shows a summary
2. The VS Code extension was capturing stdout expecting to get component code
3. Users only saw status messages like "✅ Generation Complete!" instead of the actual component

## Solution
Modified the VS Code extension to:
1. Parse the CLI output to find generated file paths (e.g., "Button.tsx ✓ Created")
2. Read the generated file from disk after CLI completes
3. Display the actual component code in a formatted code block in the chat
4. Show additional files if multiple components were generated

## Key Changes

### 1. Removed non-existent --json flag
The extension was using a `--json` flag that doesn't exist in the CLI.

### 2. Enhanced paletteService.ts
- Parse CLI output for file paths
- Read generated files after CLI completes
- Send formatted code to chat interface

### 3. Improved chat.ts UI
- Added proper code block rendering with syntax highlighting
- Support for markdown-style code blocks
- Better handling of streaming messages

## Testing
Run the test script to verify the fix:
```bash
./test-integration.sh
```

This will:
1. Test the CLI directly
2. Show expected VS Code behavior
3. Provide steps to test in VS Code

## Result
The VS Code extension now shows the same high-quality generated components as the CLI, properly formatted in the chat interface.

# VS Code Extension Test

## Current Status
- ✅ Extension compiles successfully
- ✅ Removed non-existent `--json` flag
- ✅ Should show CLI output in chat

## Expected Behavior
1. User types prompt in chat (e.g., "create a button")
2. Extension runs: `palette generate "create a button"`
3. CLI outputs validation stages, generates component, saves to file
4. User sees CLI progress messages in chat
5. **Issue**: User doesn't see the actual generated component code

## The Real Problem
The extension shows CLI status messages but NOT the generated component code because:
- CLI saves component to a file (e.g., `Button.tsx`)
- CLI outputs "✅ Generation Complete!" and table summary
- Extension captures this output and shows it
- User never sees the actual component code

## Next Steps
1. Test current extension works (shows CLI messages)
2. Add feature to read and display the generated file
3. Parse CLI output to find generated file path
4. Read file and show component code in chat

## Test Command
In VS Code:
1. Open Palette panel
2. Type: "simple button component"
3. Should see CLI progress messages
4. Check if files are created in workspace

Strategies for Enhancing Palette's Intelligence

This document outlines a comprehensive set of strategies to significantly improve the intelligence, accuracy, and user experience of the palette CLI tool. The strategies are organized into three tiers: understanding the project, improving the output, and polishing the interaction.
Tier 1: Deep Project Analysis (Understanding the Codebase)

The goal of this tier is to make palette deeply aware of the specific project it's running in. High-quality context is the foundation for high-quality generation.

1. Full tailwind.config.js Parsing

    What it is: Use a Node.js helper script to evaluate the project's tailwind.config.js file and output its theme object as JSON. Python then captures and parses this JSON.

    Why it's valuable: This is the most critical enhancement. It moves from guessing design tokens to using the project's actual, authoritative color palette, spacing scale, font families, and other theme values.

    Key Technology: Python's subprocess module, a simple Node.js script.

2. AST-Based Code Analysis

    What it is: Use a parser like Tree-sitter to analyze the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of existing React components in the user's project.

    Why it's valuable: This goes beyond configuration files to understand the project's coding conventions. You can extract:

        Prop Patterns: How they define interface or type for component props.

        Styling Idioms: Whether they use libraries like clsx or tailwind-merge.

        Component Structure: How they compose components.

        Few-Shot Examples: The actual code of an existing component can be extracted to be used as a perfect example in the prompt for the LLM.

    Key Technology: py-tree-sitter library.

3. Configuration File Support (palette.json)

    What it is: Allow users to create a palette.json file in their project root to define preferences.

    Why it's valuable: Makes the tool more flexible and professional. Users can specify default component paths (src/components/ui), preferred language (typescript), and other settings.

    Key Technology: Python's pathlib and json modules.

Tier 2: High-Fidelity Code Generation (Improving the Output)

Once you have rich context, this tier focuses on using that context to produce flawless, ready-to-use code.

4. Dynamic & Context-Aware Prompting

    What it is: Systematically enhance your system prompts using the data gathered in Tier 1.

    Why it's valuable: This is where the intelligence becomes tangible.

        Inject the actual Tailwind design tokens into the prompt.

        Use the code from an existing component (gathered via AST) as a "few-shot" example for the LLM to follow.

        Dynamically add specific instructions based on keywords (e.g., add form-specific rules if the user asks for a "login form").

    Key Technology: Advanced string formatting and logic in prompts.py.

5. Post-Generation Formatting & Linting

    What it is: After the LLM generates the code, automatically run it through a professional code formatter and linter before saving the file.

    Why it's valuable: This is the key to achieving the "Zero Manual Fixing" goal. It guarantees perfect formatting, catches potential syntax errors, and enforces code style consistency.

    Key Technology: Calling a tool like Biome or Prettier via Python's subprocess module.

Tier 3: Professional Developer Experience (Polishing the Interaction)

This tier focuses on making the CLI not just functional, but a pleasure to use.

6. Rich CLI Output

    What it is: Upgrade your terminal output from plain text to include colors, tables, spinners, and syntax-highlighted code previews.

    Why it's valuable: Massively improves the user experience. An analyze command can show a beautiful table of design tokens. A generate --preview command can show the code with full syntax highlighting.

    Key Technology: The rich library in Python.

7. Interactive Terminal UI (TUI)

    What it is: For the ultimate CLI experience, create a full in-terminal application.

    Why it's valuable: Creates a seamless, interactive workflow. After a preview, the user could be presented with interactive buttons like [A]ccept and Save, [R]efine Prompt, or [D]iscard, all without leaving the terminal.

    Key Technology: The textual library (built on top of rich).

Recommended Implementation Order

    Highest Impact:

        1. Tailwind Config Parsing: The biggest and most immediate improvement to output quality.

        5. Post-Generation Formatting: The easiest way to guarantee code quality and achieve "zero-touch" generation.

    Next Steps:

        3. Configuration File Support: A straightforward feature that adds a lot of professional polish.

        6. Rich CLI Output: Makes the tool feel much more advanced and user-friendly.

    Advanced Intelligence:

        2. AST-Based Analysis: This is the most complex but also the most powerful strategy for true project intelligence.

        4. Dynamic Prompting: Implement this in parallel with the other strategies as you gather more context.

        7. Interactive TUI: Consider this a "v2.0" feature once the core CLI is robust and widely used.
